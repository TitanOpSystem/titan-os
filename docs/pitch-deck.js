// TitanOS pitch deck — one real screenshot per slide, with talking points.
//
// Every image here was captured from the live demo (titanosdemo.vercel.app) on
// 28 July 2026, signed in as a Titan Expert, with the tenant skinned as Accurate
// Advisory Group. Nothing is a mockup, so nothing in this deck can drift away
// from what the product actually does.
//
// Colours, wordmark and tagline all come from docs/brand.js, so this deck cannot
// drift from the other generated documents. The two navy slides use the brand's
// knockout artwork (white TITAN, gold OS) because the primary logo is
// navy-on-transparent and would vanish on navy.
//
// Usage:  node docs/pitch-deck.js [output.pptx]

// screen and disappears on a projector. BRONZE is the same hue darkened to ~5:1
