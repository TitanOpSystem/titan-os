// Tests for Vault folder naming, counting and deletion.
//
// These call the real functions from src/vaultFolders.js. Written before the UI, because the
// rules worth protecting are the ones a person will hit by accident: typing a name that
// already exists in a different case, deleting a folder that still holds documents, or a
// document whose category no longer matches anything.
//
// Run: node docs/test_vault_folders.mjs
