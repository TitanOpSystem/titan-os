"""TitanOS value one-pager for RIAs — benefits, no pricing.

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
--------------------------------
This is the sheet you leave with a principal after a first conversation. It argues why an RIA should
want this at all. It carries NO pricing, no tier table and no feature list — those live in
docs/build_sales_onepager.py, which is the commercial sheet and comes second in the sequence.

Two sheets rather than one because they answer different questions and get handed over at different
moments. A value sheet that mentions price stops being read as an argument and starts being read as a
quote.

BENEFITS, NOT CAPABILITIES
--------------------------
Every block below is written as something that happens to the FIRM — relationship depth, defensibility,
capacity, referrals — not as something the software has. "Vault with expiry tracking" is a capability;
"harder to leave than a performance number" is why a principal cares. Where a capability appears it
is there as evidence for the benefit, never as the point.

CLAIMS DISCIPLINE
-----------------
Nothing here asserts a market statistic. The obvious move on a sheet like this is to open with "72%
of UHNW net worth sits outside managed accounts", and the numbers available for that are all
second-hand — compiled by vendors quoting each other. This sheet goes to buyers who check. The only
figures on the page are the property-management benchmarks, which were sourced directly from
property-management industry pricing guides and are cited in docs/PRICING-per-family.md.

# for the platform and the expert; the advisor does not earn a margin on it. Selling a firm on
# revenue it will not receive is the fastest way to lose the second meeting. The benefit is the
# relationship and the moat, so that is what these say.
