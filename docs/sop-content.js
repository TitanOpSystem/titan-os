// Single source for both SOP manuals.
//
// The internal SOP and the handbook issued to licensed firms are rendered from
// this one model so they cannot drift apart. Every capability carries both
// voices: `internal` for our own staff, `firm` for an adviser team using the
// platform under their own brand. The build script fails if either is missing,
// which is what stops one manual quietly falling behind the other.
//
// Voice rules, applied deliberately:
//   internal — procedural, blunt about traps, names the consequence of getting it
//              wrong. Assumes competence, not familiarity.
//   firm     — same facts, no PCM specifics, no platform administration, no table
//              names. Written so a firm can issue it to its own advisers.
