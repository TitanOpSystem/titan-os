// Tests that call the REAL buildFamilySnapshot, not a copy of what it does.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//
// docs/test_expense_rollup.mjs re-implements the rollup arithmetic and asserts against it.
// That let 114 assertions stay green while the real function was broken three separate
// ways at once:
//
//   1. A temporal dead zone error — expenseByCategory spread ...derivedPropertyEvents
//      before that const was initialised — so the function threw on every call and the
//      family card rendered as a blank panel. Three commits shipped it.
//   2. The snapshot's property objects carried no `id`, so every derived line got the id
//      "prop_undefined_<field>" and every suppression key collapsed to "undefined::x".
//      The suppression rule could never match, and itemised costs were double-counted.
//      The mirrored tests passed because their fixtures supplied an id the snapshot did not.
//   3. The two vendor columns were missing from the snake_case→camelCase field map, so
//      spendByVendor was always empty in the running app.
//
// None of those are visible to a test that reimplements the logic, to `npm run build`
// (Vite does not check that identifiers resolve) or to no-undef (a TDZ identifier IS
// declared). Only calling the real thing finds them.
//
// HOW IT LOADS App.jsx
//
// App.jsx cannot be imported in node: it uses import.meta.env and JSX. esbuild bundles it
// with those resolved, React and friends left external, and a test-only export appended.
// The bundle must be written inside the repo so node resolves react from node_modules.
//
// Run: node docs/test_family_snapshot.mjs
