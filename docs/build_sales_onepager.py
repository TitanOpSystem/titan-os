"""TitanOS sales one-pager — what it is, then what it costs.

WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY
---------------------
The first version of this sheet opened with two price cards. It answered "what does it cost" before
it had answered "what is it", which only works on a reader who already knows. A firm seeing the name
for the first time got mechanics and had to infer the product from a feature list. This version puts
the positioning first and compresses the tiers to what a reader needs once they understand what they
are buying — the detail belongs in the conversation the sheet is meant to start.

AUDIENCE IS THE FIRM, NOT THE FAMILY
------------------------------------
The per-household prices here are what an advisory firm pays. Their clients never see this sheet, and
never see the name TitanOS at all — which is the point of the white-label and is said on the page.

IT MUST BE ONE PAGE
-------------------
Overflow is a defect, not a formatting preference. Three guards at the end of build(): page count,
content clearing the footer rule, and each tier card reporting where its content actually ended. The
third one earned its place — at one point Core's last bullet was being drawn onto the card border,
which looked almost right.

FIGURES ARE THE FIRM'S COMMERCIAL CALL, NOT THE MODEL'S
-------------------------------------------------------
docs/pricing_model.py recommends different numbers ($750 / $2,500) off the market analysis. The ones
below are what the firm chose to sell at. Kept here in one place so the sheet cannot drift from
itself; if a price changes, change it here and regenerate. Do not "correct" these to match the model.

WINANSI ONLY
------------
Standard PDF fonts throw on anything outside WinAnsi. A tick (U+2713) is outside it; the bullet
(U+2022) and multiplication sign (U+00D7) are inside, so inclusions read as bullets and exclusions
as crosses.
