// A deliberately narrow lint config: does every identifier actually resolve?
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// Vite bundles App.jsx without checking whether an identifier is defined. A refactor
// deleted 78 lines out of buildFamilySnapshot — the document-contents block, family
// members, service providers, the net-worth totals and `const notTracked` — and the
// function went on returning nine names that no longer existed. `npm run build`
// succeeded three times in a row and three commits shipped with the AI snapshot broken.
// The family card called it on mount, threw a ReferenceError, and rendered nothing.
//
// Tests did not catch it either: the rollup logic is mirrored in docs/*.mjs, so the
// suites passed while the real function was in pieces.
//
// So this checks the one thing that was silently wrong. It is not a style config and
// deliberately enables almost nothing else — a noisy lint gets ignored, and an ignored
// lint would not have caught this.
//
// Run: npm run lint:undef
