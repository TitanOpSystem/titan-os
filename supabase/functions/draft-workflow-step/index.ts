// supabase/functions/draft-workflow-step/index.ts
// Prepares the outbound artifact for one workflow step and parks it for approval.
//
// The draft is written to the step row and the step moves to 'awaiting_approval'.
// Nothing is emailed, filed or dispatched from here — the whole point is that a
// person reads it, edits it if needed, and decides. That is what makes the rest
// of the workflow safe to automate.
//
// Facts come from the obligation, the family, the funding accounts and the text
// already extracted from the source document (the invoice or call notice). The
// model is told to use only those facts, because inventing a policy number or a
// wire detail is the failure mode that actually matters here.
