// Deployed on demo (tkryueqzvgcigvxgjzsp) v2 ONLY — the prod project (unkirihxtruhdjeldfpm) does not have this function, so there is nothing to compare against and no drift.
// One-off demo seeder: generates real PDF files for the demo families, uploads
// them to the `documents` storage bucket, and inserts the matching documents
// rows with extracted_text populated.
//
// Why a real file and not just a metadata row: the Vault opens documents through
// storage.createSignedUrl(file_path), so a row without a stored object gives a
// broken download. Writing to storage needs the service-role key, which only
// exists server-side — hence an edge function rather than plain SQL.
//
// extracted_text is set to the same body text drawn into the PDF, so the AI
// assistant can answer from document CONTENTS and its answers stay consistent
// with what the user sees when they open the file.
//
// Safe to re-run: it deletes previously seeded demo docs first.
