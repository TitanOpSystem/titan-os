// Property costs, derived into cash-flow lines.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
//
// A property's recurring costs — tax, insurance, flood, utilities, HOA, mortgage —
// are entered on the property record. They were then either (a) invisible to the
// Cash Flow tab entirely, for a property with no rental income, or (b) netted
// silently inside a single "Rental Income (Net)" line, for one with rental income.
// Either way a question like "what do we spend on insurance?" could not be answered
// from the cash-flow ledger, and firms worked around it by ALSO typing the cost into
// the Cash Flow tab by hand. That gave two records of one obligation.
//
// On the demo's Harrington family that produced a live double-count: Gulf Shore's
// $11,400 property tax was subtracted inside the netted rental line AND included in a
// manual "Property Tax Reserve" line covering both properties. Same money, counted
// twice, and only when the includeRental toggle happened to be on.
//
// DERIVED, NOT COPIED — and this is the important decision
//
// The obvious fix is to write real cash_flow_events rows when a property is saved.
// That trades one bug for a worse one: two records that can now disagree. Someone
// edits the property tax — does the row follow? Someone edits the row — does the
// property? Delete the property — does the row survive? Every answer is a rule
// somebody has to remember, and the failure is silent.
//
// These lines are computed at read time and never stored. There is exactly one place
// the number lives, so it cannot drift. This also matches what the codebase already
// did for rental income (`rental_${p.id}`, `_synthetic:true`) — the mechanism existed,
// it just netted everything into one line instead of itemising.
//
// ONE DERIVATION, TWO CONSUMERS
//
// The Cash Flow tab and the AI snapshot both call this. They used to compute property
// costs separately, which is precisely how the screen and the assistant came to
// describe the same money differently. If a figure is wrong now, it is wrong in both
// places at once, which is far easier to notice.

// Monthly amount -> annual, matching FREQ_PER_YEAR in App.jsx.
const M = 12;

// Each derived line: what it is, where it comes from, and which category it totals
// into. `field` is named so a reader can go to the property record and check it.
// `vendorField` names the property column holding who is paid, where one exists. The
// property record already carries the carrier and the lender, so a derived line can say
// who the money goes to without any extra data entry.
