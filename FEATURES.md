# TitanOS — Feature Inventory

Running record of what the platform does, written for a pitchbook rather than as
a changelog. Grouped by the problem each capability solves, because that is how a
prospect hears it.

**Status key** — `LIVE` in PCM production · `DEMO` on the pitch instance only ·
`BUILDING` in progress

Last updated: 28 July 2026 (workflows pushed to PCM production)

---

## 1. White-label, genuinely

The product is TitanOS. Every firm — including PCM — is a tenant that supplies its
own identity. Nothing about the codebase treats one firm as special.

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Brand name, logo, tagline, full colour palette per tenant | LIVE |
| Runtime brand switching from an admin screen — no rebuild, no developer | DEMO |
| Multiple saved brands, switched with one click, for concurrent sales cycles | DEMO |
| Branding flows through to exported PDFs, print reports and outbound email | LIVE |
| Branded link previews, favicons and browser chrome per tenant | LIVE |
| Dedicated database per firm — no shared tables, no shared rows | LIVE |

**The line that lands:** every client firm gets an isolated environment with its
own database, provisioned in under a day, carrying their brand end to end — down
to the PDF a client opens on their phone.

## 2. One place for the whole balance sheet

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Properties with loan, tax, insurance, flood and rental detail | LIVE |
| Portfolio accounts, including lines of credit excluded from asset totals | LIVE |
| Valuables with insured / not-scheduled status | LIVE |
| Cash flow modelling with tax treatment and multi-year projection | LIVE |
| Deals pipeline and prospect tracking | LIVE |
| Tasks, deadlines and recurring obligations | LIVE |
| Professional contacts and property vendors, click-to-call and click-to-email | LIVE |

---

## 3. Documents that are attached to the numbers

Most platforms give you a folder. This links a document to the figure it supports.

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Vault organised into folders by category | LIVE |
| AI reads uploaded documents — embedded text, and OCR for scans | LIVE |
| Documents linked to a specific property section: mortgage, tax bill, insurance declarations, insurance invoice, flood, rental agreement | LIVE |
| Valuables linked to the schedule that covers them | LIVE |
| Attach from the figure itself — a paperclip beside Property Taxes opens a pre-filled upload | LIVE |
| Replacing a document keeps the old one in the Vault, unlinked, for history | LIVE |
| Download audit log — who opened which document, and when | LIVE |
| Time-limited signed URLs; no permanent public file links | LIVE |

**The demo moment:** open a property, click the icon beside the insurance
premium, and the declarations page opens. Next year's bill replaces it in two
clicks and last year's stays on file.

---

## 4. AI that works from the client's own records

Not a chatbot bolted on. It answers from one family's data and cites the document
it used.

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Per-family assistant answering from that family's records and document contents | LIVE |
| Strictly scoped to one family — it cannot answer across relationships | LIVE |
| Floating assistant on every page; firm-wide screens ask which client first | LIVE |
| Named per family, so the client meets a consistent assistant | LIVE |
| Scheduled reports on a cadence, delivered as branded PDFs | LIVE |
| Concierge research — live web search for what a client asked the firm to watch for, with sources | LIVE |
| Document field extraction to pre-fill property records from a statement | LIVE |
| Treats document text strictly as data, never as instructions | LIVE |

**The demo moment:** ask *"is anything uninsured?"* and it names the vehicle
missing from the schedule, because it read the endorsement.

## 5. Workflows: obligations carried to completion

The difference between software that tells you something and software that gets
something done.

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Recurring obligations: premiums, estimated tax, RMDs, capital calls, loan payments | LIVE |
| Four starter playbooks ship with the product | LIVE |
| Lead times measured back from the due date, per playbook | LIVE |
| Conditional steps — e.g. Crummey notices only where the trust requires them | LIVE |
| Conditions resolved before dates are set, because they change the schedule | LIVE |
| At-risk flagged on day one when a cycle starts too late to fit its own lead times | LIVE |
| Every outbound item held for named human approval | LIVE |
| Sends from the platform, as the responsible Titan Expert on the firm's own verified domain | LIVE |
| Attachments pulled from the Vault and sent with the message | LIVE |
| Approval and sending recorded separately, each attributed; "sent" means the provider accepted it | LIVE |
| Recipients checked against the client's known contacts; an unrecognised address stops the send | LIVE |
| Send failures leave the step in the queue rather than looking successful | LIVE |
| Re-sending is impossible once a provider reference exists | LIVE |
| Every outbound draft copies the family principal, so the client sees what is done in their name | LIVE |
| The copy is suppressed when the principal is already the addressee | LIVE |
| Refuses to guess the principal when a family has several members on file — says so instead | LIVE |
| Skipped steps stay visible, so nothing looks forgotten | LIVE |
| Template library in Resources: read the exact playbook before it runs | LIVE |
| Steps read in plain language — "60 days before", who acts, to whom | LIVE |
| Admins edit lead times, actors, recipients and conditions; others read only | LIVE |
| New playbooks are rows, not code — the firm adds its own | LIVE |
| Review queue on the dashboard: everything awaiting a person, across the book | LIVE |
| Obligations tab per client: the commitment plus the playbook that carries it | LIVE |
| Starting a cycle lays out every step against a real calendar date | LIVE |
| Approving records who approved it, against the step | LIVE |
| Cycle closes itself once nothing actionable remains | LIVE |
| Playbooks provision from one migration file, identical across tenants | LIVE |

### Starter playbooks

| Playbook | Steps | Lead time | Conditional |
|---|---|---|---|
| ILIT Premium Funding | 9 | 75 days | Crummey notices |
| Property Insurance Renewal | 8 | 75 days | Market check |
| Quarterly Estimated Tax | 5 | 30 days | CPA sign-off |
| Private Fund Capital Call | 5 | 12 days | — |

**The demo moment:** start an ILIT cycle and the platform lays out nine dated
steps — transfer request to the bank 60 days out, Crummey notices two days after
the gift lands, the withdrawal window closing exactly 30 days later, and the
trustee authorised only after that. Start a capital call that arrived late and it
flags itself *At risk* naming the step that already slipped.

**Two things to say out loud in a pitch:** nothing sends without a named
approval, and the platform prepares payment instructions but never moves money.
Those are the reasons a compliance officer says yes.

## 6. Roles and permissions enforced at the data layer

Access rules live in the database, so they hold even if the application layer is
bypassed.

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Four roles: Admin, Titan Expert, Partner, Client | LIVE |
| Row-level security per family, enforced in Postgres | LIVE |
| Titan Experts see only their own book | LIVE |
| Partners: read-only, per-family grants, document upload only | LIVE |
| Clients: their own family, read-only | LIVE |
| Permission changes take effect immediately, including for scheduled automations | LIVE |
| Per-partner feature permissions, e.g. who may run scheduled reports | LIVE |
| Admin screens gated on role at the view, not only in the menu | LIVE |
| Clients may email their own advisor, never other advisors at the firm | LIVE |

---

## 7. Client experience

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Branded client portal with the firm's identity | LIVE |
| Read-only net worth, properties, accounts, valuables, documents | LIVE |
| Email their advisor from inside the portal; primary advisor always copied | LIVE |
| Mobile responsive throughout | LIVE |
| Firm-paid bills marked paid, with who paid and when | LIVE |

---

## 8. Operational quality

Unglamorous, and the reason it survives a real deployment.

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Long AI jobs run in the background — no gateway timeouts on multi-minute research | LIVE |
| Every build stamped; open tabs are told when a newer version is live | LIVE |
| Cache rules: immutable hashed assets, never-cached entry point | LIVE |
| Brand artwork versioned so a replaced logo appears immediately | LIVE |
| Artwork failure falls back to the brand name rather than a blank header | LIVE |
| Unsaved brand edits survive leaving the page | DEMO |
| Unrecognised categories fall into "Other" rather than hiding an asset | LIVE |

## Known gaps — worth naming before a prospect does

- **Cross-firm single sign-on.** A Titan Expert serving clients through several
  branded instances logs into each separately. Deliberate isolation today;
  central identity is on the roadmap.
- **MFA and an audit trail of record changes.** Document downloads and task
  completions are attributed; a full change history is not yet built.
- **Portfolio statements and cash flow line items** are not yet linked to source
  documents the way properties and valuables are.
- **Backup and recovery policy** should be stated explicitly for an enterprise
  buyer.
Fixed since the last revision, recorded because it is the kind of thing a
technical buyer will probe: outbound drafts used to take the firm name from a
server-side setting and fell back to the product name if it was unset. The
tenant's own deployment now supplies it, so a firm's letters carry the firm's
name with nothing to configure.
